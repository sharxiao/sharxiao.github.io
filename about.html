            <h4>
                I'm a UX designer with 2+ years of experience who's passionate about building digital products with a human-centred approach. During this time, I've worked in the FinTech, real estate, education, and non-profit industries.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm designing at helloart, an art-tech company that is reimagining the art discovery and buying experience. I'm also a soon-to-be graduate and a 4th-year Management student at the University of Toronto, with a specialization in Information Technology and a minor in Applied Statistics.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time, you can find me working my way through my long list of books to read, exploring the world of Zelda, or trying out new restaurants.

            <h5>What does design mean to me?</h5>
            <br>
            <p> 
                I believe that <i>design is a bridge that connects people together</i>. It serves to find a deep understanding of people that can't be found in any other place. In my personal experience, 
                I have been very fortunate to have met and collaborated with others in different crafts through design.
                <br><br>
                I also believe that <i>good design is intuitive</i>. It shouldn't be unnecessarily complex nor should it require the user to rack their brains trying to figure the design out.
                When I design, I make sure to incorporate user research and feedback into my work to validate my ideas.
                <br><br>
                I'm passionate about simplifying the tough things in life with thoughtful design, making smarter decisions quicker, and bringing diversified voices to the table.
