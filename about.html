            <h4>
                I'm a 3rd-year Management student at the University of Toronto, with a specialization in Information Technology.
                <br><br>
                My journey in design started with a pencil, paper, and love for art. For as long as I can remember, I've been creatively expressing myself through visual mediums.
                Eventually, my art transitioned into the digital world. In high school, I started exploring Photoshop in my free time and eventually took my first graphics course in grade 12.
                Once I reached university, I continued my interest in design through extracurricular roles.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm an ISD/UXD Specialist at the University of Toronto, where I'm designing to promote and empower local restaurants in the Scarborough area.

            <h5>What does design mean to me?</h5>
            <br>
            <p> 
                I believe that <i>design is a bridge that connects people together</i>. It serves to find a deep understanding of people that can't be found in any other place. In my personal experience, 
                I have been very fortunate to have met and collaborated with others in different crafts through design.
                <br><br>
                I also believe that <i>good design is intuitive</i>. It shouldn't be unnecessarily complex nor should it require the user to rack their brains trying to figure the design out.
                When I design, I make sure to incorporate user research and feedback into my work to validate my ideas.
                <br><br>
                I'm passionate about simplifying the tough things in life with thoughtful design, making smarter decisions quicker, and bringing diversified voices to the table.
