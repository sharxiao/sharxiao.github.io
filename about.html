            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <img src = "media/me.jpg" class = "me">
            <h4>
                I'm a soon-to-be graduate and a 4th-year Management student at the University of Toronto, with a specialization in Information Technology and a minor in Applied Statistics.
                <br><br>
                I'm passionate about building digital products with a human-centred approach. I believe people should make up the core of everything we do, and data should be used to justify our decisions.
                <br><br>
                Previously, I've worked at Caseware, the University of Toronto, and most recently, I'm designing at Epic Investment Services, where I'm learning how we can transform the spaces around us through real estate.
                <br><br>
                In my spare time, you can find me working my way through my long list of books to read, exploring the world of Zelda, or trying out new restaurants.

            <h5>What does design mean to me?</h5>
            <br>
            <p> 
                I believe that <i>design is a bridge that connects people together</i>. It serves to find a deep understanding of people that can't be found in any other place. In my personal experience, 
                I have been very fortunate to have met and collaborated with others in different crafts through design.
                <br><br>
                I also believe that <i>good design is intuitive</i>. It shouldn't be unnecessarily complex nor should it require the user to rack their brains trying to figure the design out.
                When I design, I make sure to incorporate user research and feedback into my work to validate my ideas.
                <br><br>
                I'm passionate about simplifying the tough things in life with thoughtful design, making smarter decisions quicker, and bringing diversified voices to the table.
            </p>

                Okay, that's enough about me! With all there is to learn, I'm always open to exploring new opportunities. If you're interested in connecting, please
