            <p>
                I spent 8 months working at <a href = "https://www.caseware.com/" target = "_blank">Caseware</a>, a FinTech company that helps businesses in the accounting and auditing industry work more efficiently and derive insights
                with its software solutions. From January to August of 2021, I worked on the Smart Engagements team at Caseware as a UX Designer Co-op.
                <br><br>
                In this role, I focused on projects that revolve around <b>automating
                accounting and audit processes</b> to better help our users complete their tasks faster and more efficiently. I also had the chance to work on design projects for our internal design team that
                explored our design process and identified our values as a group.
                
                <br><br>
                While the projects I worked on during my co-op are under an NDA, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to talk about my experience at Caseware!
            </p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Coming soon!</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Thank you üíõ</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                To my manager and mentors, Aleesha, Mehak, and Reece, for their endless guidance, support, and kindness. To the rest of the design team as well as the cross-functional teams
                that I worked with that helped to foster my growth as a designer and collaborator during these 8 months.
