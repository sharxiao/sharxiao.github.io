            <p>
                During the summer of 2022, I spent the summer working at <a href = "https://epicinvestmentservices.com" target = "_blank">Epic Investment Services</a>.
                From May to August, I worked on the Marketing & Communications team at Epic as a Design Co-op.
                <br><br>
                In this role, I designed various graphics, branded merch, wayfinding signage, and web pages. I had the opportunity to work on multimedia projects with a dedicated team and gained valuable experience in corporate design + branding.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Introduction - Renfrew Centre Website Redesign</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the highlights of my co-op at Epic was redesigning the website for the Renfrew Centre, one of Epic's properties. I had the chance to lead the redesign from conception to designing the final prototype.
                During the length of this project, I worked closely with the Property Manager (PM), VP of Marketing & Communications, Communications Specialist, and Developer.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                There were two main problems that we were tackling with the Renfrew Centre: <br><br>1) <b><b>Revitalization of Renfrew's image</b></b><br>2) <b><b>Website redesign</b></b><br><br>
                First, we were looking to modernize Renfrew's image. To do this, we discussed different elements from the colour palette to the different fonts to be used. 
                I also redesigned the logo to simplify it while retaining a core part of what makes Renfrew so recognizable, which is its unique building silhouette. 
                However, it was also important to tie in the Epic branding into the website so that it was clear that this is an Epic property site.
                <br><br>Second, the existing Renfrew website was due for a redesign. Tenants could not find the information they were looking for, and the visual design of the website did not align with the Epic branding.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, I followed a five-step process as follows:</p>
            <img src = "media/epic-process.jpg" class = "amacssCoverPic">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In discussions with the PM, she helped us to narrow down 3 key areas that she noticed tenants had pain points with.
                These became the main insights that we aimed to address with the new design.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "media/epic-insights.jpg" class = "amacssCoverPic">
            <h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beyond speaking with the PM as a proxy for speaking with tenants directly for their feedback, we also examined existing Epic property sites to observe common features
                as well as the order that information was presented.
                <br><br>
                Specifically, I looked at the websites for Centre 10 and HSBC Place, two other Epic properties. From exploring both sites, I noted the following key takeaways:
                <br><br>- <b><b>Similar menu bar</b></b>: the content can be broken down into information about the building, tenants, sustainability, etc.
                <br>- <b><b>Differing complexities</b></b>: the Centre 10 website was a single-page scroll with anchors at different sections while the HSBC Place website had different pages to separate the content
                <br>- <b><b>Epic branding</b></b>: in addition to using Epic colours and fonts, the brand icons were also used throughout both websites, particularly in the sustainability section
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Problem statement</h5>
            <br>
            <p>With the research complete, a problem statement was created to help guide the rest of the design process:</p>
            <br>
            <p style = "text-align:center;"><i>How might we reimagine the Renfrew Centre website so that it is more intuitive to navigate and engaging to tenants?</i></p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the main objectives of this project was to enhance the navigation experience for users. The old site not only had outdated information 
                but it was also difficult for tenants to find the section of information that they were looking for, as noted by the PM.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Single- or multi-page?</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                Therefore, one of the first decisions to be made was whether to stick with a single-page scroll or switch to a multi-page design. Ultimately, <b><b>simplicity was highly valued</b></b> for this project. 
                <br><br>
                Other factors that were considered included the subject of the website and the ease of moving from one section of information to another. Since this website was focused solely on one subject, the Renfrew Centre, 
                separating the limited content into multiple pages wasn't necessary as the content could be condensed onto a single page. Additionally, the use of a fixed menu bar and a single-page scroll allows the user to navigate from 
                one section of information to another more quickly without loading a new page.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Lo-fi wireframes</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
                Following the decision to use a single-page scroll design and from what I'd learned from the research, I had an idea of the website layout and some general features that we wanted to highlight, so I sketched some low-fidelity wireframes on paper.
            </p>
            <img src = "media/epic-wireframes.jpg" class = "amacssCoverPic">
            <br><br>
            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                The high-fidelity prototype was created on XD and several iterations of the website were presented to stakeholders. If you'd like to play around with one of these iterations, 
                you can check out one of the prototypes <a href = "https://xd.adobe.com/view/7e72a8e4-78ce-4f71-94e5-96f57cdc53e5-2b21/?fullscreen" target = "_blank">here</a>!
                <br><br>
                A few parts of the website that I wanted to highlight:

            <img src = "media/epic-proto4.jpg" class = "amacssCoverPic">

            <img src = "media/epic-proto3.jpg" class = "amacssCoverPic">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although my co-op work term ended before the development stage fully started, I was able to finish the final iteration of the design and hand it off.

            <br><br>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This was my first time leading a design project end-to-end while working with a cross-functional team as the sole designer. Through this experience, I was able to practice aligning my designs to fit business needs and objectives.
                This project also gave me the creative freedom to completely redesign a website within corporate brand guidelines, which was a new and insightful experience for me as well.
                <br><br> 
                Overall, I'm super grateful for the trust that my manager put into me for taking this project on, and it was really great to see the finished website and how closely it resembled my design :)
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Other projects from that summer</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Beyond the Renfrew redesign, I also had the chance to work a variety of other projects, such as reimagining the Epic corporate site, 
                designing company greeting cards, and creating graphics for Epic's many events.
