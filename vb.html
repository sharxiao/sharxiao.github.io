            <p>
                In the last quarter of 2022, I started working at <a href = "https://www.africanimpact.ca" target = "_blank">African Impact Initiative</a> as a UI/UX Designer. Specifically, I worked with the team on one of its initiatives, African Impact Challenge (AIC).
                <br><br>
                AIC is an annual challenge based in Africa that invites early-stage entrepreneurs to build and pitch their venture with an experienced team. Teams receive funding, mentorship, and other resources to grow their business.
                <br><br>
                As my work at African Impact Initiative is under a confidentiality agreement, I'm unable to share all the details, but please feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my experience!

            <h2>What I worked on</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                During these few months, I had the opportunity to work on various tasks to build the foundation of Venture Build in light of launching the MVP (minimum viable product). 
                In particular, I focused on user research and drawing insights from our findings to aid in product decisions.

            <p>
                To the entire team at African Impact Initiative for being so supportive and easy to work with. Specifically, to Jessica for teaching me so much about working with a product manager and building an MVP. 
                To Dave for providing me with another opportunity as a work-study student - endlessly grateful that I got to work at The BRIDGE.
